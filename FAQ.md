# Frequently asked questions Statistics/Econometrics

## General statistics

- Correlation and independence: [No-correlation does not imply independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Correlation_and_independence). Why? Since correlation is [linear relationship similar to regression coefficient](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/344619/162538).

- What does '*certainty equivalence*' mean?: [Answer 1](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/19898/5764), [Answer 2](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/9554/61).

- What is the difference between *factor* and *covariate*? See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/70826/162538).

- Expectation is minimizing squared deviation and median is minimizing absolute deviation: [here](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/10/04/expectation-median-opt/), [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113270/the-median-minimizes-the-sum-of-absolute-deviations-the-ell-1-norm), and [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/118/why-square-the-difference-instead-of-taking-the-absolute-value-in-standard-devia).

- Variance of random variables does not always exist: [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4007718).

- t-test vs z-test: [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/507081/162538) and [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/61292/162538).

- What is a *test statistic*? Imbens & Rubin (2015), page 64.

- Why would we add independent variables to a regression?
  - In observational studies with causal interpretations: to adjust for confounding
  - In observational studies with no explicit causal interpretation: make allow for comparisons between units, eg. "when comparing two children whose mothers have the same level of education, the child whose mother is X IQ points higher is predicted to have a test score that is 6x higher, on average" (Gelman, Hill, Vehtari 2021 p. 134)
  - In predection tasks, to increase (in-sample) goodness of fit ([non-decreasing property of R2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/401466/162538))

## Estimation

- What is the difference between MLE and least-squares? [Here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/143705/maximum-likelihood-method-vs-least-squares-method) and [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/12562/equivalence-between-least-squares-and-mle-in-gaussian-model).

## Causality

### Causality, general

- [Definition of Structural Causal Model](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/312130/162538)

- [Why is over identified models preferred over just identified models in Structural Equation Modeling?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/183021/why-is-over-identified-models-preferred-over-just-identified-models-in-structura/183024)

- What is the difference between predetermined (weak exogeneity), strictly exogenous (strong exogeneity), and Granger causality?
  - See pages 199-200 Killian & LÃ¼tkepohl 2017.
  - Super exogeneity: see Pearl (2009, section 5.4.3, p.165)

- [Under which assumptions a regression can be interpreted causally?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/493905/162538)

- [How are interaction terms representented in DAGs?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/350132/162538)

- Pearl's view of Lucas critique: [Pearl 2015](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r391-reprint.pdf) page 5

- [Granger Causality vs. Pearl's/Rubin's causality frameworks](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/144328/162538)

- How propensity scores differ from adding covariates in a regression?
  - [In theory the same](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/8610/162538)
  - [Regressions extrapolates](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/8655/162538)
  - [Using both is "doubly robust"](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/248967/162538), see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943670/) section 5.

### Causality, PO vs SCM

- [Pearl's comments on Imben's paper *Potential Outcome and Directed Acyclic Graph Approaches to Causality*](http://causality.cs.ucla.edu/blog/index.php/2020/01/29/on-imbens-comparison-of-two-approaches-to-empirical-economics/)

- Pearl's view on "No causation without manipulation": Pearl (2009, section 11.4.5, p.361)

- Pearl's view on ignorability assumption: Pearl 2009, pages 79, 100, 341

- Interpretation of potential outcomes as error terms of a SCM: Pearl 2009, p.343.

### Causality, time series

- [What is the difference between identification, calibration and estimation?](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/36639)

## Cross-section

### Cross-section, standard errors

- When to use clustered stadard errors?
  - Based on [this paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24003/w24003.pdf), clustering of SEs is either *experimental design* or *sampling design* issue.
  - *Experimental design*: so-called "Moulton" problem where cluster of units, rather than individual units, are assigned to a treatment. See [this](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/when-should-you-cluster-standard-errors-new-wisdom-econometrics-oracle) and Angrist & Pischke (2008) chapter 8.2.1
  - *Sampling design*: What matters for clustering is how the sample was selected and whether there are clusters in the population of interest that are not represented in the sample. See [this ](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/when-should-you-cluster-standard-errors-new-wisdom-econometrics-oracle).
  - Note that fusing fixed effects vs. SE clustering answer different thins, see [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/185378/when-to-use-fixed-effects-vs-using-cluster-ses) and also the reference paper.

## Panel data

### Panel data, standard errors

- When to use clustered stadard errors in panel models?
  - In addition to cross-section case, one might need to think about serial correlation. See Angrist & Pischke (2008) section 8.2.2.

## Time series

### Time series, general

- What is ergodicity? See equation 1 of [Peters (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0.pdf).

### VAR - reduced form

### VAR - structural form

## Quantile regression

- What are assumptions behind quantile regression?: [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/321001/162538) and [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/39003/162538)
